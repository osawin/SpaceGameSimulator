I'm trying to design a board game. Storywise, the game is representing spaceships fighting, without trying to accurately represent reality. Mechanically, each player controls a set of ships, each of which has a position and capabilities, and they take turn moving and attacking. The goal is a game where players have to understand how different ships are better or worse against each other, and use the strengths of some of their ships to cover their other ships weaknesses. However, all that is the board game. This code is a simulation of a simplified version of a fight between each pair of classes of spaceships. The purpose is to help judge which ships are too strong or too weak, and which ships are better or worse against each other. I use this information to alter the capabilities of the different ships to make them closer to even overall, and to make sure each ship has some good and bad matchups.
